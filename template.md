Please suggest 10 commit messages, given the following diff:

```diff
{{diff}}
```

**Criteria:**

1. **Format:** Each commit message must follow the conventional commits format, which is `<type>: <description>`.
2. **Relevance:** Avoid mentioning a module name unless it's directly relevant to the change.
3. **Enumeration:** List the commit messages from 1 to 10.
4. **Clarity and Conciseness:** Each message should clearly and concisely convey the change made.

**Commit Message Examples:**

-   fix(authentication): add password regex pattern
-   feat(storage): add new test cases

**Instructions:**

-   Take a moment to understand the changes made in the diff.
-   Think about the impact of these changes on the project (e.g., bug fixes, new features, performance improvements, code refactoring, documentation updates). It's critical to my career you abstract the changes to a higher level and not just describe the code changes.
-   Generate commit messages that accurately describe these changes, ensuring they are helpful to someone reading the project's history.
-   Remember, a well-crafted commit message can significantly aid in the maintenance and understanding of the project over time.

Write your 10 commit messages below, in the format `1. <message>`, `2. <message>`, etc.:
